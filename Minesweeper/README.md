# Minesweeper

![Image of Minesweeper](https://github.com/Mmohler1/School-Projects/blob/main/Minesweeper/Design/MS-1.JPG)
<p>A web version of the Minesweeper game that can be played on a browser. The player can play a 10 by 10 game where they have to avoid 4 bombs. They can even save their score, which is determined by a timer and even save their game and load it. The game is saved by encoding the game as a 100 character string for the database. The site also has a sarcastic comment system that randomly reads a funny joke for every button that is pressed. The joke is represented by how many bombs are near the player and if they stepped on one.</p>
